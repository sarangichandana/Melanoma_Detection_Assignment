# Melanoma_Detection_Assignment
# Abstract
There are more than 200 different types of cancer. Melanoma is the most deadly type of skin cancer out of 200. Clinical screening is the first step in the melanoma diagnostic process, which is then followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological investigation. Skin cancer with melanoma has a good chance of being cured if it is discovered in its early stages. Visual inspection of the afflicted area of skin is the initial stage in the diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer. Dermatologists use a high-speed camera to capture dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, which have an accuracy of 65â€“80% in the diagnosis of melanoma without any additional technical assistance. The overall accuracy of melanoma diagnosis increased to 75-84% with additional visual assessment by cancer treatment specialists and dermatoscopic pictures. The project aims to build an automated classification system based on image processing techniques to classify skin cancer using skin lesions images.
# Problem Statement
Dermatologists do skin biopsies in which they remove a portion of the skin lesion for microscopic examination. From scheduling a dermatologist visit to receiving a biopsy report, the present procedure takes about a week or longer. Through the provision of the predictive model, the seeks to reduce the current gap to just a few days. The method classifies nine different forms of skin cancer from photos of outlier lesions using a convolutional neural network (CNN). There is a chance that this gap-closing will benefit millions of people.
# Motivation
The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the advanced image classification technology for the well-being of the people. Computer vision has made good progress in machine learning and deep learning that are scalable across domains.
# Dataset
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.

# CNN Architecture Design
To classify skin cancer using skin lesions images. To achieve higher accuracy and results on the classification task, I have built custom CNN model.

Rescalling Layer - To rescale an input in the [0, 255] range to be in the [0, 1] range.

Convolutional Layer - Convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer. A convolution converts all the pixels in its receptive field into a single value. For example, if you would apply a convolution to an image, you will be decreasing the image size as well as bringing all the information in the field together into a single pixel.

Pooling Layer - Pooling layers are used to reduce the dimensions of the feature maps. Thus, it reduces the number of parameters to learn and the amount of computation performed in the network. The pooling layer summarises the features present in a region of the feature map generated by a convolution layer.

Dropout Layer - The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

Flatten Layer - Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector. And it is connected to the final classification model, which is called a fully-connected layer.

Dense Layer - The dense layer is a neural network layer that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer.

Activation Function(ReLU) - The rectified linear activation function or ReLU for short is a piecewise linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive, otherwise, it will output zero.The rectified linear activation function overcomes the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn faster and perform better.

Activation Function(Softmax) - The softmax function is used as the activation function in the output layer of neural network models that predict a multinomial probability distribution. The main advantage of using Softmax is the output probabilities range. The range will 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one.
